  CLV Motors - New and used car sales website üöóüèéÔ∏è
</h1>

<p align="center">
   When we started this journey, we noticed a gap in the automotive sales market. There was a lack of platforms that offered a complete, intuitive and reliable experience for car lovers. So we decided to create something unique, something that didn't just sell vehicles, but was a space for car lovers to connect, explore and discover their next machine on wheels.
</br>Our team is constantly working to improve the site's interface, making it more user-friendly and informative. We want our users to find not just a car, but all the information they need to make the best possible decision.

## Materials and Methods

  <p align="justify"> 
    The car sales website was developed using a combination of technologies to ensure an efficient and attractive user experience. In the front-end layer, languages such as HTML were used to create the fundamental structure of the site, CSS for styling and design to ensure an attractive visual presentation and JavaScript to make the platform interactive and dynamic.
    </br> On the back-end, the site was programmed with PHP, enabling an efficient connection to the database and the execution of the CRUD method (Create, Read, Update, Delete). This structure enables operations such as creating, reading, updating and deleting data in the database, making car sales functionalities possible.
