  CLV Motors - New and used car sales website 🚗🏎️
</h1>

<p align="center">
   When we started this journey, we noticed a gap in the automotive sales market. There was a lack of platforms that offered a complete, intuitive and reliable experience for car lovers. So we decided to create something unique, something that didn't just sell vehicles, but was a space for car lovers to connect, explore and discover their next machine on wheels.
</br>Our team is constantly working to improve the site's interface, making it more user-friendly and informative. We want our users to find not just a car, but all the information they need to make the best possible decision.

This is a project where we are learning how use PHP language, however, we have built a site based on HTML and embellished it with CSS for a better user experience (UX).
